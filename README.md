# sphere

A modern Python implementation of the HAZUS flood methodology for building
vulnerability and loss estimation. This repository packages a set of libraries
(`sphere-core`, `sphere-data`, `sphere-flood`) that implement flood
vulnerability functions, lookup tables, and analysis scripts suitable for
research and operational use.

This project is a newer reimplementation of HAZUS flood vulnerability logic
with a focus on clarity, type annotations, and tested, modular code.

Key features
- Building vulnerability functions (HAZUS-derived)
- Flood damage cross-reference and interpolation utilities
- Example analysis scripts in `examples/`
- Test coverage under `tests/`
